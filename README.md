# Njabulo Mchunu Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This site showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way to contact me. It is built with plain HTML and CSS, no frameworks or libraries used.

---

## Overview

This portfolio site includes:

- **About Me:** A brief introduction.  
- **Skills:** A list of technical skills I have mastered.  
- **Projects:** Descriptions and links to my key projects and their GitHub repositories.  
- **Contact:** A contact form powered by Formspree to receive messages.  

The site features a clean, responsive design with smooth scrolling and subtle hover animations, and supports dark mode for better accessibility.

---

## How to Edit

1. **HTML:**  
   - The main file is `index.html`.  
   - Update section content within `<section>` tags (About, Skills, Projects, Contact).  
   - Navigation links correspond to section IDs for smooth scroll.

2. **CSS:**  
   - The styles are in `style.css`.  
   - Colors, fonts, and animations can be customized here.  
   - Responsive design and dark mode are included via media queries.

3. **Projects & Links:**  
   - Update project descriptions and URLs in the Projects section of `index.html`.

4. **Contact Form:**  
   - Uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) for submissions.  
   - Change the form action URL in the Contact section if you use a different Formspree endpoint.

## Deployment

- The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for free and fast access:  
  [Live Portfolio](https://inkosana.github.io/portfolio/)  

- To deploy updates:  
  1. Commit and push changes to the GitHub repository.  
  2. GitHub Pages automatically updates the live site.

## Notes

- Navigation uses inline links with separators for clean UI.  
- Smooth scrolling is enabled via CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth`).  
- CSS contains comments for tricky sections like animations and dark mode support.  
- The project follows accessibility best practices with semantic HTML and form labels.
